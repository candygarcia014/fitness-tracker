# fitness-tracker

## **Description**
This app allows the user to track their workouts and add workouts to their routine. It also provides the user with a dashboard of their workouts to see a chart flow of their progress. 

The date and the workout duration are not working. I have tried many things :( I will try to talk to my instructor and tutor about it.
